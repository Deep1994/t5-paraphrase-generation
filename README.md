# t5-paraphrase-generation
â€‹T5 Model for generating paraphrases of english sentences. Trained on the Quora Paraphrase dataset.

## How to use
First, you should install [Simple Transformers](https://github.com/ThilinaRajapakse/simpletransformers) via:
```
pip install simpletransformers
```

Then, you can fine-tune the T5 model via:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train.py --train
```

After training finished, you can evaluate the trained model via:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train.py --eval
```
Note that, if you don't pass the decoding argument, the model default use top k/ top p sampling, for beam search decoding, use:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train.py --eval --beam_search
```

All the arguments about train and eval are in 'train.py'.


For BLEU calculation, use:
```
python bleu.py --predictions_file your_predictions_file.txt
```

## Result
Model: t5-small
beam sarch: BLEU = 29.34 63.8/38.7/26.1/18.1
top k/ top p sampling: BLEU = 21.48 56.6/29.8/18.0/11.4

Although top k/ top p sampling has lower bleu, the diversity of generated paraphrase is higher. On the contrary, beam search has higher bleu but lower diversity.

Original Question ::
What is the meaning of living?

Beam search: 
0: How can I improve my English?
1: What should I do to learn English?
2: How can I learn to speak English?
3: How can I improve my English language?
4: How do I know English?

Top k/ Top p sampling:
0: How can I improve my spoken English?
1: How can I improve my English?
2: How can I learn English?
3: How do I learn English?
4: How can I improve my English speaking?
```
